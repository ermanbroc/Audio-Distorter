### Description

Distorts the audio of an MP3/WAV file to the users preference, allowing for a shift in tone & speed, crunching audio, as well as translating stereo to mono.

### Purpose

To be able to adjust audio samples to meet certain criteria or adjust sound quality.

### Requirements

Must have MATLAB installed and up to date

### Example

Import the code into the user's MATLAB environment, along with any .MP3 or .WAV file. Once the main script is opened, rename the originalfilename variable (line 8) to the name of your imported file. Change the newfilename variable (line 9) to the preferred name of the output file. Rewrite the variable values on lines 11-13 with preferred values. To mute sound, add a '%' at the beginning of line 31. To write to the output file, remove the '%' at the beginning of line 34. Run the script to begin testing/playing with values.
